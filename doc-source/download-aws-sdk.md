# Downloading an AWS SDK<a name="download-aws-sdk"></a>

If you want to call the Amazon SES API without having to handle low\-level details like assembling raw HTTP requests, you can use an AWS SDK\. The AWS SDKs provide functions and data types that encapsulate the functionality of Amazon SES and other AWS services\. To download an AWS SDK, go to [SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk)\.

The Getting Started section of this guide provides examples of how to send an email using the AWS SDKs for various programming languages\. For more information, see [Send an Email Through Amazon SES Using an AWS SDK](send-an-email-using-sdk.md)\.
