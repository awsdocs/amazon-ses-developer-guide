# Obtaining Amazon SES SMTP credentials<a name="smtp-credentials"></a>

You need an Amazon SES SMTP user name and password to access the Amazon SES SMTP interface\.

The credentials that you use to send email through the Amazon SES SMTP interface are unique to each AWS Region\. If you use the Amazon SES SMTP interface to send email in more than one Region, you must generate a set of SMTP credentials for each Region that you plan to use\.

Your SMTP password is different from your AWS secret access key\. For more information about credentials, see [Types of Amazon SES credentials](send-email-concepts-credentials.md)\.

**Note**  
SMTP endpoints are not currently available in Africa \(Cape Town\), Europe \(Milan\), Middle East \(Bahrain\)\.

## Obtaining Amazon SES SMTP credentials using the Amazon SES console<a name="smtp-credentials-console"></a>

When you use the SES workflow below to generate SMTP credentials by using the console, you are taken to the IAM console to create an IAM user with the appropriate policies to call Amazon SES and provides you with the SMTP credentials associated with that user\.

**Requirement**  
An IAM user can create Amazon SES SMTP credentials, but the IAM user's policy must give them permission to use IAM itself, because Amazon SES SMTP credentials are created by using IAM\. Your IAM policy must allow you to perform the following IAM actions: `iam:ListUsers`, `iam:CreateUser`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`, and `iam:PutUserPolicy`\. If you try to create Amazon SES SMTP credentials using the console and your IAM user doesn't have these permissions, you see an error that states that your account is "not authorized to perform iam:ListUsers\."

**To create your SMTP credentials**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon SES console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ses/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/)\.

1. Choose **SMTP settings** in the left navigation pane \- this will open the **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\) settings** page\.

1. Choose **Create SMTP Credentials** in the upper\-right corner \- the IAM console will open\.

1. \(Optional\) If you need to view, edit, or delete SMTP users youâ€™ve already created, choose **Manage my existing SMTP credentials** in the lower\-right corner \- the IAM console will open\. Details for managing SMTP credentials is given following these procedures\.

1. For **Create User for SMTP**, type a name for your SMTP user in the **IAM User Name** field\. Alternatively, you can use the default value that is provided in this field\. When you finish, choose **Create** in the bottom\-right corner\.

1. Expand **Show User SMTP Security Credentials** \- your SMTP credentials are shown on the screen\.

1. Download these credentials by choosing **Download Credentials** or copy them and store them in a safe place, because you can't view or save your credentials after you close this dialog box\.

1. Choose **Close Window**\.

You can view a list of the SMTP credentials you've created using this procedure in the IAM console under **Access management** and choosing **Users** followed by using the search bar to find all users that you've assigned SMTP credentials\.

You can also use the IAM console to delete existing SMTP users\. To learn more about deleting users, see [Managing IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html) in the *IAM Getting Started Guide*\.

If you want to change your SMTP password, delete your existing SMTP user in the IAM console\. Then, to generate a new set of SMTP credentials, complete the previous procedures\.

## Obtaining Amazon SES SMTP credentials by converting existing AWS credentials<a name="smtp-credentials-convert"></a>

If you have an IAM user that you set up using the IAM interface, you can derive the user's Amazon SES SMTP credentials from their AWS credentials\.

**Important**  
Don't use temporary AWS credentials to derive SMTP credentials\. The Amazon SES SMTP interface doesn't support SMTP credentials that have been generated from temporary security credentials\. 

To enable the IAM user to send email using the Amazon SES SMTP interface, do the following\.
+ Derive the user's SMTP credentials from their AWS credentials by using the algorithm provided in this section\. Because you're starting from AWS credentials, the SMTP user name is the same as the AWS access key ID, so you only need to generate the SMTP password\.
+ Apply the following policy to the IAM user:

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "ses:SendRawEmail",
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

  For more information about using Amazon SES with IAM, see [Identity and access management in Amazon SES](control-user-access.md)\.

**Note**  
Although you can generate Amazon SES SMTP credentials for any IAM user, we recommend that you create a separate IAM user when you generate your SMTP credentials\. For information about why it's good practice to create users for specific purposes, go to [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html)\.

The following pseudocode shows the algorithm that converts an AWS secret access key to an Amazon SES SMTP password\.

```
 1. // Modify this variable to include your AWS secret access key
 2. key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY";
 3.             
 4. // Modify this variable to refer to the AWS Region that you want to use to send email.
 5. region = "us-west-2";
 6.             
 7. // The values of the following variables should always stay the same.
 8. date = "11111111";
 9. service = "ses";
10. terminal = "aws4_request";
11. message = "SendRawEmail";
12. version = 0x04;
13. 
14. kDate = HmacSha256(date, "AWS4" + key);
15. kRegion = HmacSha256(region, kDate);
16. kService = HmacSha256(service, kRegion);
17. kTerminal = HmacSha256(terminal, kService);
18. kMessage = HmacSha256(message, kTerminal);
19. signatureAndVersion = Concatenate(version, kMessage);
20. smtpPassword = Base64(signatureAndVersion);
```

Some programming languages include libraries that you can use to convert an IAM secret access key into an SMTP password\. This section includes a code example that you can use to convert an AWS secret access key to an Amazon SES SMTP password using Python\.

**Note**  
The following example uses **f\-strings** that were introduced in Python 3\.6; if using an older version, they won't work\.  
Currently, the Python SDK \(Boto3\) officially supports 2\.7 and 3\.6 \(or later\)\. However, 2\.7 support is deprecated and will be dropped on 7/15/2021, so you'll need to upgrade to at least 3\.6\.

To obtain your SMTP password by using this script, save the preceding code as `smtp_credentials_generate.py`\. Then, at the command line, run the following command:

```
python path/to/smtp_credentials_generate.py wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY us-east-1
```

In the preceding command, do the following:
+ Replace *path/to/* with the path to the location where you saved `smtp_credentials_generate.py`\.
+ Replace *wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY* with the secret access key that you want to convert into an SMTP password\.
+ Replace *us\-east\-1* with the AWS Region in which you want to use the SMTP credentials\.

When this script runs successfully, the only output is your SMTP password\.
