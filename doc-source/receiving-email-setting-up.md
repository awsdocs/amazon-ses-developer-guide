# Setting up Amazon SES email receiving<a name="receiving-email-setting-up"></a>

This section describes what you need to do to configure Amazon SES to receive your mail\. For example, you should first consider how you want to receive, filter, and process your mail, because those decisions will affect how you configure Amazon SES\. You also need to verify your domain with Amazon SES to prove that you own it, and then configure your domain to send incoming mail to Amazon SES\. Next, you give Amazon SES permission to access AWS resources\. Finally, you configure email receiving by creating a receipt rule set, receipt rules, and IP address filters\.
