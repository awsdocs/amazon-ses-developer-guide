# API Error Codes Returned by Amazon SES<a name="using-ses-api-error-codes"></a>

This topic contains a list of error codes that are returned by the Amazon SES API\. For more information about the Amazon SES API, see the [Amazon Simple Email Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/)\.

You should retry HTTPS requests that receive 5xx errors\. In this case, to reduce the likelihood of generating duplicates, we recommend that you implement an exponential retry method with progressively longer waits \(5, 10, and 30 seconds\) between consecutive timeouts\. If the third retry call does not succeed, perform another set of retries after 20 minutes\. For an example implementation that uses an exponential retry policy with Amazon SES, see [How to handle a "Throttling \- Maximum sending rate exceeded" error ](https://aws.amazon.com//blogs/messaging-and-targeting/how-to-handle-a-throttling-maximum-sending-rate-exceeded-error/) on the Amazon SES blog\.

**Note**  
AWS SDKs implement retry logic [ automatically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html)\.

HTTPS client errors \(4xx\) indicate that you need to revise the request to correct the problem before trying again\. For example, if your AWS authentication credentials are invalid, you must update your setup to use the proper credentials before trying to send the email again\.
