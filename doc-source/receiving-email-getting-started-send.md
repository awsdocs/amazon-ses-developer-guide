# Step 4: Send a test email<a name="receiving-email-getting-started-send"></a>

Now that you've verified and configured your domain, you can send an email to test your domain's ability to receive email\.

To send a test email, use an email account that you know is capable of sending email, such as your personal email address\. Send a test message to any email address on your verified domain\. For example, if your domain is *example\.com*, you can send an email to *test@example\.com* or *abc123@example\.com* \(or any other address on the *example\.com* domain\)\.

**Note**  
You don't need to complete any additional steps to create individual email addresses on your domain—Amazon SES receives every email that is sent to any address on the verified domain, and applies the receipt rule you created in [Step 3: Set up a receipt rule](receiving-email-getting-started-receipt-rule.md)\.
